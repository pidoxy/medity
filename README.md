# Medity


## Inspiration
Due to the scale of the COVID-19 we've come to realize something that has always been which is that when it comes to  fighting diseases some countries are ahead and that could be of advantage to people from less experienced countries and that is how we came up with the idea of creating a app that gives people in less experienced countries the opportunity to have firsthand information...as someone whose home country is from this bracket to have such information I have to do my individual research or listen to news and that is even if I know what to research on

Also, the newscasters would only broadcast such info when diseases have actually started to cause a negative impact.
## What it does
The purpose of this app is to prevent such...rather than curing it.
With this app individuals would have updates of various diseases, their symptoms, treatments and how to go about avoiding contracting them

## How we built it
The team discussed what features we were to implement and constructed designs using Figma and built the app itself with react utilizing KendoReact's UI components, focusing on mobile responsiveness because we believe the majority of our users will be mobile users

## Challenges we ran into

So far our biggest challenge has been implementing real-time covid statistical data using the KendoReact chart component

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the  work we've done so far on and we know it will help make the world a better place 

## What we learned

## What's next for Medity

We'll see
