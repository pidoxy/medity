# Medity


## Inspiration

Due to the scale of the COVID-19, we have come to realize that when it comes to  fighting diseases, more medically advanced countries have the ability to help countries that have less developed information. Medity aims to give people in less experienced countries the opportunity to access firsthand information. As someone whose home country is from this bracket, Emmanuel would have to do individual research to access accurate and updated information on diseases, especially since newscasters broadcast medical information only after diseases have actually started to cause a negative impact. But through Medity, information can be updated and accessed at a global scale, spreading medical news and disease updates to anyone in the world.

## What it does

With this app, individuals can access general information on various diseases, their symptoms, treatments and how to go about avoiding contracting them. Furthermore, they can get updated news from anywhere in the world, categorized into the different diseases. On the mobile app, users would get notifications of the most impactful updates so everyone can be aware of medical or regulatory developments. Furthermore, the home page features charts, quick access to trending topics, and a search bar so users can conveniently find whatever information they are seeking.

## How we built it

The team discussed what features we were to implement and constructed designs using Figma and built the app itself with react utilizing KendoReact's UI components. We focused on mobile responsiveness because we believe the majority of our users will be mobile users but also made a web version of the app for access of our information from any device.

## Challenges we ran into

The key challenge for Medity was that current pandemic information is not centralized. Thus, we had to research and centralize all the data from various sources and simplify them into an easily readable format. For our current version, we personally compiled the information, but we hope to find a solution that involved experts for future development.

We also found that real-time data consumed a lot of memory. For our current version, we simplified the data by making it static but for the future we would hope to implement an API instead.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the  work we've done so far on and we know it will help make the world a better place. We really believe in the mission of our web app and hope that centralized accurate information on pandemics can unite people all around the world to help each other fight deadly diseases. 

Furthermore, we are proud of the simple UI designs that make information accessible and easily readable. We were also able to implement real-time data into the web app, making the information as updated as possible.

## What's next for Medity

For a future version of Medity, we are considering expanding the data we deliver, covering info from more parts of the world. For example, we would like to add a COVID-19 vaccine locator and testing centre locator and regional regulation section that would display accurate rules on what citizens at a specified location can and can't do in regards to the pandemic. In addition, many of the users we target may not be native English speakers so we were also considering making the app accessible to those of native languages.

To improve upon our **number one** challenge, we are thinking of creating an API for a future version that would make real-time updates even more accessible. We are also hoping to find a way to increase performance while using real-time data as well without consuming much memory space because the majority of users might not have the luxury of high memory spaces.
